reactjs vs reactnative = reactjs, because instant access
javascript, typescript = typescript, because code quality
className vs inline vs styledcomponents = styledcomponents, because css-in-js is the future
css transition/keyframes vs react-spring = react-spring, because it allows for more complex animations
function declaration vs arrow function = arrow function, because that's the default in eslint
max number of chars per line = 80, because that's the default in prettier

blocking
go for gi or tt or so = ?
should progrtemp be open or close = ?
should i use create-react-app or next or gatsby for progrtemp = ?
what should be the name of progrtemp = ?

inclinattion
gi, because it's react-oriented
close, because that's legally safe
create-react-app, more chances to impress chalenges, with lazy loading routes, lazy loading imgs and seo optimization
